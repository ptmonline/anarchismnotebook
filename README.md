*Anarchism is democracy taken seriously. **- Edward Abbey***

*I believe that in time we will have reached the point where we will deserve to be free of government.. **- Jorge Luis Borges***

*Guilt is not a response to anger; it is a response to oneâ€™s own actions or lack of action. If it leads to change then it can be useful, since it is then no longer guilt but the **beginning of knowledge**. Yet all too often, guilt is just another name for impotence, for defensiveness destructive of communication; it becomes a device to **protect ignorance** and the continuation of things the way they are, the ultimate protection for changelessness. **- Audre Lorde***
